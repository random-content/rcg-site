  "title":"About Random Content Generator",
  "content":"<p>Random Content Generator began as a simple concept passed around between friends and coworkers. After months of playfully floating ideas for software projects — some more viable than others — we came to a collective realization: if we had an entity to represent all of us, our software ideas wouldn't have to stay ideas. We could make real things together to impact real people.</p><p>But we weren't interested in creating a traditional corporation. The notion of practices like maintaining board members, distributing profits, or keeping meeting minutes didn't align with our vision. As such, we designed Random Content Generator as a software development co-op, where every member has an equal stake in the company's future, and we each are compensated solely for the work we put in.</p><p>Our aims are twofold: we want to work together to bring our ideas to life in a way we never could have at traditional jobs, and we want to offer our services to anyone out there who has an idea they believe can make a difference. Our members are multitalented and versatile; together we have the skills to create and deliver full-stack solutions from the ground up.</p><p>Random Content Generator exists to make dreams into reality. So what's yours?</p>"
