  "content": "<p>In keeping with our name, we've got a diverse array of interests and a ton ideas for really cool projects across many different areas of software â€” from a fast-food themed rhythm game, to a jukebox app for house parties, to an Etherium-mining web browser. We've even kicked around launching a podcast where we record our brainstorming sessions.</p><p>In these early days our primary effort has been to find that sweet spot where we can maintain the flow of ideas while choosing a selection to dive into and bring to life. Unfortunately we haven't quite matured any one project far enough to share yet, but we're all excited about moving forward and making some awesome things.</p><p>So check back soon for more info about the stuff we've been working on! And in the meantime, feel free to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" check us out on GitHub (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://github.com/random-content\" target=\"_blank\">check us out on GitHub</a>.</p>"
